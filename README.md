Why this plugin exists
- The challenge: Elementor makes it easy to design pages, yet embedding background YouTube videos can blow up load times. The YouTube iframe API is powerful, but loading it on every page can degrade Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and user experience.
- The solution: delay the heavy video until the user interacts or scrolls near the element. Start with a lightweight placeholder that preserves layout and visuals, then swap in the full video only when needed.
- Practical goals: reduce initial page weight, trim render-blocking requests, improve Time to Interactive (TTI), and keep a smooth, visually pleasing experience for visitors.

Core features
- Delayed YouTube backgrounds: video iframes load only after user engagement or when the section enters the viewport.
- Admin panel: straightforward controls to enable, disable, and fine-tune behavior from the WordPress admin area.
- Privacy mode: option to restrict data tracking and reduce external requests when privacy concerns or cookie-balance rules apply.
- Per-page rules: define specific delay behavior on a per-page basis. Exclude a page or force immediate load when needed.
- Responsive support: works across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints. Keeps aspect ratio and layout intact.
- Elementor integration: designed to work well with Elementor sections, columns, and full-width blocks without breaking the page builder workflow.
- Lightweight placeholders: use modern placeholders or overlays that resemble the final look while staying fast.
- Fallback behavior: if the video cannot load, the placeholder remains visible and accessible.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigable controls and ARIA attributes to help screen readers interpret the placeholder and the eventual video.
- Local development friendly: simple hooks and filters to customize behavior for advanced sites.

How it works in practice
- Initial render: Elementor sections render with a static placeholder. The placeholder preserves aspect ratio and presents a visually similar experience to the final video.
- Triggering events: the plugin monitors user actions (scroll, hover, click, or focus) and viewport visibility. When a trigger fires, it loads the YouTube iframe behind the scenes.
- Swapping logic: once the video is allowed to load, a seamless swap occurs. The placeholder transitions to the embedded video without layout shifts, preserving the page flow.
- Privacy first path: if privacy mode is enabled, the plugin limits data sharing with YouTube and uses a sanitized embed path, reducing data leakage and third-party requests.
- Per-page granularity: site admins can specify which Elementor sections delay video loading and which load immediately, giving full control over specific experiences.

Quick start guide
- Prerequisites: a WordPress site with Elementor installed and active. A PHP version compatible with modern WordPress standards. Access to the admin dashboard to install and configure plugins.
- Install the plugin: upload the plugin zip from the Releases page or install via the WordPress plugin installer after adding the repository as a source if you prefer a developer install.
- Activate the plugin: navigate to Plugins, locate the Background Video Delay plugin, and click Activate.
- Open the admin panel: in the WordPress admin, find the new “Background Video Delay” section. From here you can enable the feature, choose default behavior, and tailor settings.
- Configure a page: edit a page with Elementor. In the page settings, enable delayed loading for the background video in the desired sections. Adjust the placeholder visuals to fit your design.
- Test the behavior: reload the page and scroll to the section. Confirm that the placeholder loads first and that the video swaps in after the trigger.
- Fine-tune: use per-page rules to adjust threshold, delay times, and privacy mode on the fly.

Admin panel and settings
- Global controls: enable/disable the feature site-wide, choose default trigger (scroll, hover, click), and set a default delay window before loading the video.
- Privacy mode toggle: allow or restrict data collection by the YouTube embed. When enabled, the embed uses privacy-enhanced URLs that do not set cookies by default.
- Placeholder customization: select between a few placeholder styles, colors, and overlays to match your site design.
- Per-page configuration: a list of pages with toggleable rules. You can override the global defaults for any page.
- Debug and logging: optional verbose logging to help diagnose issues during setup or during page builds.
- Compatibility options: switch to a fallback mode for themes or Elementor versions that require special handling.

Per-page rules and blocklists
- Per-page rules: target specific pages by ID, slug, or template. For each page, you can:
  - Enable or disable delayed loading.
  - Change the trigger type (scroll, hover, click).
  - Override the delay duration before the video begins to load.
  - Choose a custom placeholder style for that page.
- Allowlists and blocklists: maintain lists of pages or templates that must always defer or always load immediately.
- Template-level rules: apply rules to all sections created with a given Elementor template, ensuring consistency across multiple pages.
- Conflict handling: the system detects conflicts with other performance plugins and warns you in the admin panel. It suggests a safe fallback to maintain page integrity.

Privacy mode and data handling
- What privacy mode does: minimize data sharing with YouTube, avoid unnecessary cookie-setting interactions, and use privacy-friendly embed URLs by default.
- User consent: the plugin respects user consent preferences and can defer data-heavy loads until consent is given, depending on your site’s cookie banner strategy.
- Data you control: there is no personal data stored by the plugin outside of standard WordPress plugin settings. You can export or purge settings like any other WordPress option in the database.
- Compliance considerations: the approach aligns with common privacy policies and can help with compliance efforts when YouTube is used as a background video.

Performance impact and LCP goals
- LCP improvement: deferring heavy iframe loads reduces initial render time and helps achieve better LCP scores. The visible content often loads faster since the page does not wait for the video player to initialize.
- Speed budgets: the plugin is designed to minimize main-thread work during initial render. It uses lightweight placeholders and non-blocking scripts to reduce CPU time and memory usage.
- Network savings: delaying iframe requests lowers the number of outbound requests during the critical render window. It can also reduce initial DOM size and script evaluation times.
- Real-world testing notes: results vary by page, video length, and network conditions. The plugin provides metrics in the admin panel to help quantify improvements across pages.
- Progressive enhancement: on pages where the video is not essential, the content remains usable and accessible even if the video never loads.

Developer guide and API
- Architecture overview: the plugin uses a modular approach with a core loader, a placeholder renderer, and a video embed handler. The core orchestrates when to swap placeholders for real iframes.
- Key hooks and filters:
  - bgvde_delay_enabled: toggle the feature at runtime.
  - bgvde_triggers: customize trigger events per element.
  - bgvde_placeholder_style: define the appearance of placeholders.
  - bgvde_privacy_mode: enable or disable privacy-constrained embeds.
- Extending the plugin: developers can add new placeholder styles, new trigger strategies (e.g., on scroll depth or on user interaction), or integrate with other plugins that modify Elementor layouts.
- APIs and data structures: a simple per-element configuration object stores rules such as enable/disable, trigger type, delay duration, and placeholder class.
- Testing: run local tests by setting up a minimal WordPress environment with Elementor, then load a page with a section that has the delay feature. Use browser dev tools to inspect the DOM and network requests during different triggers.

Localization and accessibility
- Translation readiness: all labels, toggles, and error messages are prepared for localization. English is the default, with strings available for translation.
- Accessibility: ARIA roles and labels are added to placeholders and loaded video players. Keyboard users can tab to the section and trigger loading with the Enter or Space keys if the UI supports it.
- Color contrast: ensure placeholder overlays meet WCAG contrast guidelines. If needed, admins can choose a higher-contrast placeholder style.

Troubleshooting
- Common issues and quick fixes:
  - The placeholder does not display: check that Elementor sections are recognized by the plugin and that the section has a valid aspect ratio class.
  - The video never loads: verify privacy mode settings and ensure the page is not blocking YouTube domains by other security plugins.
  - The placeholder overlay covers content incorrectly on mobile: review responsive settings and per-page rules for mobile breakpoints.
  - Conflicts with caching plugins: ensure the plugin’s script loading order is compatible with your caching strategy. Consider excluding the delay logic from page cache if needed.
- Debug tips: enable verbose logging in the admin panel. Inspect console logs for errors related to the YouTube embed or IntersectionObserver callbacks. If you see a 403 or blocked request, confirm domain allowlists or privacy mode constraints.

Compatibility and requirements
- WordPress versions: tested with recent WordPress core releases. Requires a compatible PHP version per WordPress recommendations.
- Elementor compatibility: designed to work with standard Elementor sections and widgets. Some third-party add-ons that alter the DOM structure may require manual tweaks or per-page overrides.
- Theme compatibility: works with most themes that respect Elementor’s layout system. In rare cases, themes that heavily modify iframes or background rendering might need adjustments.
- Browser support: modern browsers with IntersectionObserver support are preferred. Polyfills are available for older environments if necessary.

Migration notes
- Upgrading to a new release: always test on a staging environment before applying to production. Review the per-page rules to confirm behavior didn’t change unintentionally after an update.
- Data migration: plugin settings are stored in WordPress options. Upgrades usually preserve settings, but you may need to re-check page-level rules after major version changes.
- Theme and plugin conflicts: if you upgrade and notice layout shifts or missing placeholders, audit other plugins that interact with iframes or with Elementor. Temporarily disable conflicting plugins to isolate the issue.

Code snippets and configuration ideas
- Per-page rule example (conceptual):
  - Page ID: 42
  - Enable: true
  - Trigger: on-scroll
  - Delay: 8000 ms
  - Placeholder: glossy-blue
  - Privacy: enabled
- Global setting example:
  - Default trigger: on-hover
  - Global privacy: on
  - Placeholder style: subtle-shadow
- Inline note for developers:
  - The plugin exposes a small API surface for customization: use the filters to tweak trigger behavior or placeholder rendering. For example, to add a new trigger strategy, hook into bgvde_triggers and supply your own callback.

Localization and translation notes
- Translation flow: strings are wrapped in translation-ready functions and exposed to .pot/.po/.mo workflows.
- Contributors can add new language files under the languages directory. After translating, rebuild assets to include the updated strings.

Usage scenarios and best practices
- Large hero sections: you can delay big video experiences while keeping the hero image or animation visible during initial paint.
- Multi-section layouts: apply per-section rules to avoid loading all videos at once in long pages.
- Privacy-first sites: use privacy mode to minimize third-party data sharing while still delivering an engaging page experience.
- Affiliate and media-heavy sites: balance the user experience with revenue considerations by tailoring loading strategies per page or per template.

Design principles
- Visual fidelity with performance: placeholders should resemble the final scene closely to avoid jarring shifts.
- Predictable behavior: always know when a video will load for a given section. If you can observe a page that uses many delayed videos, the experience should feel coherent.
- Minimalism: prefer lightweight placeholders to reduce initial rendering work. Keep UI clean and unobtrusive until interaction.

Resource usage and performance considerations
- Network: the plugin reduces early network requests by deferring YouTube iframe loads.
- CPU: initial render uses lighter scripts; full video load consumes more CPU during playback initialization.
- Memory: using a placeholder reduces memory usage on the initial paint.
- Storage: plugin settings take a small footprint in the WordPress database but are easy to back up and migrate.

Roadmap and future improvements
- More trigger options: depth-based triggers, time-based delays, or user-interaction-specific rules.
- Expanded media support: extend the approach to other video providers or to background video formats beyond YouTube if needed.
- Enhanced analytics: integrate with analytics tools to provide precise metrics on delayed video loads and their impact on page performance.
- Advanced per-page control: allow more granular control per section, including dynamic page rules updated by A/B testing outcomes.
